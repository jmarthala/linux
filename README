##Assignment 1:

#Aim:
The aim of this assignment is to create a Linux kernel module that queries various MSRs to determine virtualization features available in CPU. The module reports th efeatures it discovers. Following things needs to be developed.
    * Configure a Linux machine, either VM based or on real hardware. You may use any Linux 
    distribution you wish.
    * Download and build the Linux kernel source code
    * Create a new kernel module with the assignment functionality
    * Load (insert) the new module
    * Verify proper output in the system message log.
#Funtionalities:
    * Read the VMX configuration MSRs to ascertain support capabilities/features
    * Entry / Exit / Procbased / Secondary Procbased / Pinbased controls
    * For each group of controls above, interpret and output the values read from the MSR to the system
    via printk(..), including if the value can be set or cleared.
    
#Implementation details:
* Install VMware Workstation on the Windows 11 machine.
* Downloaded the Operating system image of the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Desktop version.
* Spin up a new virtual machine with below settings of Ubuntu OS in VMware Workstation.
